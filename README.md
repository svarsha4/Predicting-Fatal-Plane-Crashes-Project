### Business Problem

Our project aims to determine which model is most effective at predicting the likelihood of the severity of a plane accident,
where 1 represents a fatal accident and 0 represents otherwise.


### Requirements to Use the R Code

The following packages have been used for writing all our code:

1) ggplot2
2) pROC
3) RColorBrewer
4) randomForest
5) dplyr
6) glmnet


### Data Used

We used the airplanes accident severity dataset, which can be found on Kaggle
using the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/abilashcheruvathur/airplane-accident-severity-analysis-prediction/data
